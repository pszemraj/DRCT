# DRCT Inference Performance Guide

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Memory Format Optimization
**What it does**: Uses `channels_last` memory format for input tensors and model weights.
**Why it helps**: Better memory access patterns on modern GPUs, reducing bandwidth bottlenecks.
**Usage**: Enabled by default. No user action required.

### 2. Precision Control
**What it does**: Allows selection of FP32, FP16, or BF16 precision for inference.
**Why it helps**: BF16/FP16 reduces memory usage by ~50% and increases throughput on modern GPUs while maintaining quality.
**Memory impact**: 
- FP32: 4 bytes/element (highest quality, highest memory usage)
- BF16/FP16: 2 bytes/element (~50% memory savings, slight quality tradeoff)
**Usage**: Use `--precision bf16` (default on Ampere+ GPUs) or `--precision fp16` for older GPUs.
**Tradeoffs**: Lower precision may introduce slight numerical artifacts in very demanding scenarios, but generally imperceptible in image super-resolution.

### 3. Batched Tile Processing
**What it does**: Processes multiple tiles in batches rather than one at a time.
**Why it helps**: Better GPU utilization and reduced Python overhead.
**Memory impact**: 
- Each tile requires memory proportional to tile_size² × scale_factor²
- Batch size N increases memory usage by approximately N× but improves throughput
- Default batch_size=1: minimal memory overhead
- Recommended batch_size=4: ~4× memory usage but 2-3× speedup
**Usage**: Control batch size with `--tile_batch_size N` (default: 1).
**Tradeoffs**: Higher batch sizes increase VRAM usage but improve GPU utilization and throughput. Reduce batch size if running out of memory.

### 4. Stream Overlap
**What it does**: Uses multiple CUDA streams to overlap Host-to-Device transfers with computation.
**Why it helps**: Hides memory transfer latency, improving overall throughput.
**Memory impact**: 
- Each additional stream requires duplicate input/output buffers
- 2 streams: ~2× memory usage for I/O buffers, 1.5-2× speedup
- 4 streams: ~4× memory usage for I/O buffers, up to 2.5× speedup (diminishing returns)
- Default streams=1: minimal memory overhead
**Usage**: Enable with `--streams N` (default: 1). Recommended values: 2-4.
**Tradeoffs**: More streams increase memory usage for buffering but can significantly improve throughput by overlapping computation with data transfers. Best used with sufficient VRAM headroom.

### 5. Efficient Padding
**What it does**: Uses `F.pad` with `reflect` mode instead of flip-concat operations.
**Why it helps**: More memory efficient and faster than the original implementation.
**Usage**: Enabled by default. No user action required.

### 6. Attention Mask Caching
**What it does**: Caches computed attention masks to avoid recomputation.
**Why it helps**: Reduces redundant calculations in transformer blocks.
**Usage**: Enabled by default. No user action required.

### 7. Flash Attention 2
**What it does**: Uses PyTorch's Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA) with Flash Attention 2 support for memory-efficient attention computation.
**Why it helps**: Reduces memory complexity from O(N²) to O(N) where N is sequence length (tile_size²), enabling larger tile sizes with less VRAM usage.
**Memory impact**: 
- Original attention: Memory scales with tile_size⁴
- Flash Attention 2: Memory scales more linearly with tile_size²
- Larger tiles (512x512, 1024x1024) see significant memory savings
**Usage**: Enabled by default. No user action required.
**Tradeoffs**: May show minimal speedup on small tiles but provides substantial benefits with larger tiles and longer sequences. Automatically falls back to standard attention on unsupported hardware.

## Usage Tips

1. **For maximum speed**: Use `--precision bf16 --streams 2 --tile_batch_size 4`
2. **For memory-constrained systems**: Reduce `--tile_batch_size` and `--tile` size. With Flash Attention 2, you can use larger tiles (e.g., 512x512) with less memory penalty than before.
3. **For quality-sensitive applications**: Use `--precision fp32` (slower but highest precision)
4. **Monitor GPU utilization**: Use `nvidia-smi -l 1` to find optimal batch/stream settings

## Future Work

1. **Automatic tile sizing**: Implement `--tile_auto` to automatically select optimal tile size based on available VRAM
2. **Hann window blending**: Add `--hann_blend` for smoother tile boundaries with less overlap
3. **CUDA Graphs**: Implement static graph capture for fixed tile configurations (significant speedup when shapes are constant)
4. **TensorRT support**: Add ONNX-TensorRT path for additional optimizations
5. **Async I/O**: Offload image loading/saving to separate threads to avoid blocking main loop
